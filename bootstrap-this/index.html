        <p class="text-center">Bootstrap may look quite confusing in the beginning, but it gets easier once you get a hang of this amazing developing tool. To understand Bootstrap, one might need to have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS (of course) and all the basic elements that come with those languages.</p>

            Bootstrap was originally named “Twitter blueprint.” In the beginning, it was just made as a framework to endorse and support consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, there were several libraries that were being used for the development of interfaces. A large number of libraries caused a lot of inconsistencies. Along with the actual developer, Mark Otto and a few colleagues (several other team members from Twitter) contributed to this project in the Twitter "Hack Week." Bootstrap was then introduced as an open source project. It had a twelve-column responsive grid layout system. It was no longer used solely as an internal tool maintainer for Twitter.

      <!-- For this part of the page (features) I used a container for the entire content of features to make it easier to add row and col classes. I also used the row and col classes as I did with the content in order to test out the responsive attribute of bootstrap. -->
      <!-- Dividing the content into two columns as they exceed the large breakpoint was done so that the content would be easier to read and not stretched out on the screen -->

          <h2>Why is Bootstrap used at a scale it is being used today?</h2>
          <p>
            It’s simple, fun and easy to understand! Bootstrap as an interface developing tool can do a lot of things. Here are some of the features that make Bootstrap a widely used tool:</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>1. It is beginner friendly</h3>
                <p>
                  Anyone, literally anyone can use Bootstrap (of course a basic understanding of HTML and CSS is required), but as a tool that comes with pre-sets and components ready to be used, it doesn’t take much time to get started, which is probably the first reason why it is appealing.
                </p>
              </div>
              <br>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>2. Easily Customizable</h3>
                    <p>
                      Even though Bootstrap is designed in responsive 12-column grids, layouts, and components, it is also very easy to customize. Whether you need a fixed grid or a responsive one, it can be made possible by making a few changes. Offsetting and nesting of columns are also easy to do in both CPU-based and mobile-based browser grids.
                    </p>
                
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <h3>3. Responsiveness</h3>
                    <div class="row">
                      <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <p>
                          Bootstrap is a responsive framework that incorporates a fluid 12 grid system for creating mobile ready websites. It uses two patterns depending on what the project demands and deems better:
                          Firstly, we have the grid system, where one can use grids by laying down the 12 column width metrics for the website layout. Secondly, we have the flex system which allows faster and easier management of individual Bootstrap components like size of columns in the grid or the layout of content within a grid.
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <p>
                          Bootstrap also has Responsive Breakpoints. These breakpoints aid in building complex responsive layouts which are more straightforward due to the presence of five sets of classes. The five classes cover extra-large, large, medium, small, and extra-small screen widths.</p>
                          <p>
                            Bootstrap also has Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.</p>

              <p>Utilities is a part of Bootstrap that is responsible for CSS styling. CSS is the primary component that you need to utilize for customization. Some of the most useful utilities include –</p>

                  <p class="pl-4">Subtractive border utilities helps one from removing borders from an element. You can achieve that by simply putting a 0 after the border-top or border-right value, like this: <em>border-top-0</em></p>

                      <p class="pl-4">Spacing is an essential utility which consists of both padding and margin, to help enhance the appearance of your elements.</p>
                      <p> class="pl-4">Spacing is defined by two properties:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><em>m</em> stands for margin</li>
                        <li><em>p</em> stands for padding</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p class="pl-4">Next are the sides:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><em>t</em> - stands for margin-top or padding-top</li>
                        <li><em>b</em> - stands for margin-bottom or padding-bottom</li>
                        <li><em>l</em> - stands for margin-left or padding-left</li>
                        <li><em>r</em> - stands for margin-right or padding-right</li>
                        <li><em>x</em> - stands for both left & right</li>
                        <li><em>y</em> - stands for both top & bottom</li>
                        <li><em>blank</em>stands for setting a margin or padding on all 4 sides of the element</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p class="pl-4"> Sizing of these margins and padding depends on numeric values ranging from 0-5 and then auto.</p>

            <h2>Drawback of Bootstrap</h2>
            <p>Everything has its pros and cons. We have talked about the features that make Bootstrap appealing. Now we will discuss a few flaws and drawbacks of Bootstrap. One of the biggest drawbacks is its free availability. Since it is a "Free for all" program, there are higher chances of people using common themes on their individual websites. Now, there is big competition to develop the most unique and different website using the same library that maybe 10,000+ people are already using or have used. Due to increased use in this modern day and time where websites have such a big part of a person’s everyday life, it has become quite easy to determine which websites and applications have used the same template unless they have been heavily and massively customized.</p>

            <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
            <p>So now that you learnt a few things about Bootstrap and its features, it is time that we jumped into the real thing.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The first thing you will have to do is get the starter template of the latest version of Bootstrap. <br> <br>
                <a class="btn btn-dark" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/" role="button">Click Here!</a> to get the Starter template.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>The next step is to open up a coding software like VSCode and paste the Starter template that you will copy from Bootstrap.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Now that you have the default/starter template, you can add componenets and utilitites to your website. This framework will not only give you a clear slate and idea, but it will also provide you with enough tools to create a responsive website without using a lot of CSS.</li>
